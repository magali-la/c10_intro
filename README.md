This project was made as part of my Web Development course with HerTechTrail Academy. 

Using DOM manipulation to generate background colors after clicking a button. Also, in addition to changing the color, it needed to also generate a list of the colors. We had the freedom to do it in whichever way, so I immediately thought of a color generator.

The JavaScript file has some explanations that helped me remember the reasoning behind the syntax, and hopefully help others who might be interested in learning this for the first time.

Future iterations can add other features, like the option for a user to pick a choice of moods like "happy, sad, excited, bright, pale, neutral" to further personalize the experience. 

Those mood buttons could that trigger a specific list of pre-selected colors.
