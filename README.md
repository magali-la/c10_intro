This project was made as part of my Web Development course with HerTechTrail Academy. 

Using DOM manipulation to generate background colors after clicking a button. In addition to changing the color, the site needed to generate a list of the colors. We had the freedom to do it in whichever way, so I immediately thought of a color generator website and log.

This uses minimally styled HTML and CSS. The JavaScript file has some explanations that helped me remember the reasoning behind the syntax for the functions, and hopefully help others who might be interested in learning this for the first time.

Future iterations can add other features, like the option for a user to pick a choice of moods like "happy, sad, excited, bright, pale, neutral" to further personalize the experience. Those mood buttons could trigger a specific list of pre-selected colors. Also, it would be nice to have the color log also display a small thumbnail with the color, and a back button for ease of use in case users accidentally move too fast and want to go back.

Open to any feedback, comments, or contributions!
